IMPORTANT: Root Folder Rename Instructions

The root folder needs to be renamed from "temp-web-aec" to "ifctester-revit".

Since the folder is currently open in your workspace, please follow these steps:

1. Close VS Code/Cursor (or close the workspace)
2. Navigate to C:\code\
3. Rename the folder: temp-web-aec → ifctester-revit
4. Reopen the workspace from the new location

Alternatively, you can run this PowerShell command after closing VS Code:
  cd C:\code
  Rename-Item -Path "temp-web-aec" -NewName "ifctester-revit"

All code changes have been completed and the project builds successfully.
The workspace file has been updated to remove references to deleted folders.
